It's missing a drawer divider and it's scratched. For some reason I can't really fathom, I decided to color in the scratches with a brown marker, even though I'm a master finish carpenter. I guess I was just incredibly lazy when I was getting ready to sell this furniture.\n(strategy: propose) system: Then with all that said would you take $50 for it?\n(strategy: counter) user: 50 seems way too low, lets have a little more negotiation here. Let me tell you, this is a very sturdy piece of furniture, it can easily take the weight of two adults slamming into it for at least 20 minutes. That's how it got the scratches.\n(strategy: counter) system: Oh wow okay. Well with all your telling me this doesn't seem worth much more than 50 to me. \n(strategy: counter) user: Friend, this is the perfect side table for so many things, the drawers are big enough to hold all sorts of adult toys. It would be a steal at $80.\n(strategy: counter) system: Hmm how about 70 if i come get it today?\n(strategy: counter) user: Okay, you come to pick it up, you can have it for $75, and I'll even throw in whatever's left in the drawers when you get here. Don't worry, it's all been sterilized.\n(strategy: agree) system: Okay deal. 75 it is. \n"}

The wife and kids will love that. Does it come fully furnished?\n(strategy: deny) user: No, you'll be responsible for furnishing it yourself. \n(strategy: deny) system: Hmm that may be a problem with all of those steps we need to climb. The bed, the grand piano, the grandfather clock...\n(strategy: affirm) user: No worries! It's a first-floor apartment \n(strategy: affirm) system: Why was the unit extensively remodeled after only 2 years? Was there some sort of damage?\n(strategy: affirm) user: Not particularly. We like to replace all carpets after tenants who have pets -- even if there is not extensive damage, we find new tenants enjoy the brand-new features. If you think you might be interested in a tour, we can set something up?\n(strategy: propose) system: We can but the price seems a bit steep for only 2 bedrooms. I know the asking price is $2595 but would $2000 be doable?\n(strategy: counter) user: Sorry, no. That's much too low for the area. I'm confident we'll have interest in the apartment at $2595. I can drop it as low as $2495. \n"}

How about if I waive your security deposit and have you sign a 3-year lease.  This way you go into the rental with a bit of extra cash to allow you to reorganize your budget.

I would definitely be able to come down a bit on the rent, however I wont be able to budge too much. This bedroom unit is very close to downtown, and prices in this area are very competitive!\n(strategy: counter-noprice) system: If i sighed a year lease and paid for all the rent up front what would you be willing to do? \n(strategy: propose) user: Well, annual rent at the list price of 2250 would come out to 27000, but if you would be willing to sign the years lease, I could bring it down to about 25200. It may seem like its not significantly less, but with almost all of the utilities included, the savings would definitely be meaningful, given that there are so few bills left to pay.\n(strategy: counter) system: Could we make it a round 24k cash payment? Or 2000 a moth and could I bring my cat, Ed? He's very docile and litter trained.\n(strategy: counter) user: While I dont mind the accomodation of pets (heck, I actually love them!), there would need to be an additional deposit for housing the pets, just in case something did happen. Normally, for a listing like this the deposit would be around 1500, but I could lower the price a bit more, to 24,900 plus an 800$ deposit \n(strategy: counter) system: That sounds perfect, works out to $2075 a month so that's what I am offering but I will be paying it all up front plus the pet deposit. \n(strategy: agree) user: Sounds good to me.

That's a used bike of a very unremarkable design. $50 would generous even at a pawnbroker.\n(strategy: counter) user: No.  I'm asking $200, but would be willing to take $165.  That's the lowest I'll go.  \n(strategy: counter-noprice) system: I'd pay half that for a used 18-speed, not a 7 with a fixed front sprocket.\n(strategy: counter) user: I think you're looking at the wrong bike then.  This is an upgraded Jamis.  Are you not willing to pay the $165?  I'm not even going to consider $50.\n(strategy: counter) system: Well that's a shame considering that's about what you're looking at for a used low-end bike, which is effectively worth nothing to you if it's not sold at all. The question here is whether or not $165 is worth waiting forever for, or whether you'll accept 75 and get on with your life.\n"}
