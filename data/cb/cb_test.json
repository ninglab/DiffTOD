Would you like to see it?\n(strategy: counter) system: Before I see it, I have a few questions. Are any utilities included in the rent. $10995 is a bit much and are pets allowed?\n(strategy: counter-noprice) user: No, utilities are not included, and small pets are allowed with a pet deposit. Keep in mind that you could have 18 or more people sharing the rent, depending on how you furnish the bedrooms, so that brings down the per-person price a lot!\n(strategy: counter) system: Yeah, more people equals less per person, but I don't want too big a crowd. Some people just aren't clean. How about we start out at $5000 for 5 people and renegotiate later if I need to bring more people in?\n(strategy: counter) user: That's less than half price! My boss would kill me! I can't go lower than $8000. How many people you share with is up to you.\n(strategy: disagree) system: Okay, I'm just trying to save you the eviction process if we can't pay. I think I can find 3 more people and get you $8000 but we'll need water and gas covered.\n(strategy: agree) user: I could do that.\n"}
