A skillfully lugged and elegantly pantographed vintage Italian road bike. Paint is light metallic blue with yellow highlights and matching decals. No scratches, no dents. I have received many, many compliments on this beautiful bike. Frame: 54cm (center to center) Seat Tube and Top Tube (approx 21 inches) Lightweight Columbus SL tubing throughout frame and forks. The 6x2 drivetrain is the highly-sought-after Shimano 600 \"Arabesque\" with early Shimano Dura-Ace headset, brakes and hubs laced to 700c Mavic clincher rims. Cinelli stem and bars. Everything has been expertly cleaned, lubed, and tuned. The bike runs smoothly and efficiently. ALL NEW: chain; cables and cable housing; bar tape; and Vittoria Open Corsa clincher tires w/ classic tan side-walls. Retired bike racer Marcello Faggin started making bikes in Padua, Italy in 1945. He continued to hand-make steel frames through the mid-1980s. (This bike is estimated to be from the late-1970s, early-1980s.)

{"text": "item decription: Vintage Italian Steel - Marcello Faggin (Fah-Zheen) Special A gorgeous, classic Italian road bike by a legendary frame-builder. A skillfully lugged and elegantly pantographed vintage Italian road bike. Paint is light metallic blue with yellow highlights and matching decals. No scratches, no dents. I have received many, many compliments on this beautiful bike. Frame: 54cm (center to center) Seat Tube and Top Tube (approx 21 inches) Lightweight Columbus SL tubing throughout frame and forks. The 6x2 drivetrain is the highly-sought-after Shimano 600 \"Arabesque\" with early Shimano Dura-Ace headset, brakes and hubs laced to 700c Mavic clincher rims. Cinelli stem and bars. Everything has been expertly cleaned, lubed, and tuned. The bike runs smoothly and efficiently. ALL NEW: chain; cables and cable housing; bar tape; and Vittoria Open Corsa clincher tires w/ classic tan side-walls. Retired bike racer Marcello Faggin started making bikes in Padua, Italy in 1945. He continued to hand-make steel frames through the mid-1980s. (This bike is estimated to be from the late-1970s, early-1980s.) Today, 70 years after the company was founded, it is still family-owned, and still focuses on quality steel bikes.\nseller price: 390\nbuyer price: 650\n(strategy: inquire) system: I love this bike!!

I really cant do anything over 400\n(strategy: counter) user: This is a vintage Marcello Faggin, I couldn't let it go for only $400. Frankly, in this condition it would be a steal at twice the list price.\n(strategy: counter) system: Yes, but you need it gone correct. Probably just sitting there collecting dust. How about $550. Knock 100 bucks off for a girl!\n(strategy: counter) user: Well, just consider the 6x2 drivetrain. In good condition those alone go for about $200 in some circles. It really is a fair price at $650, in a bike shop a used Faggin in this condition could go for $900 easily.\n(strategy: agree) user: Okay, great, I'm glad we could make a deal :)\n"}
